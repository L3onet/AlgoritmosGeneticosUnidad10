# Aspecto 1

Write a continuous or binary hybrid GA that uses one of the following local optimizers:

- Nelder-Mead downhill simplex
- BFGS
- DFP
- Steepest descent
- Random search

# Aspecto 2

Compare several different methods of sampling the initial population. Use averaging and three different test functions. Does one method work better than the others?

# Aspecto 3

Develop a hybrid PSO algorithm and test it.
